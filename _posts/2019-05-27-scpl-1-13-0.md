# 1.13.0, ScPL Update

ScPL 1.13.0 has a new `@Def` macro and `@Error` macro.

## New Features

> The `@def` macro now lets you define custom macros. Use `@def [argument list] @{handler}`
> to define a macro. More info at the bottom of the getting started guide.

## Minor Changes

- A new macro `@error` has been added to error with a provided string.
- The `@set` macro now accepts `@:` as the first argument so that `@set @:myvar "value"` works as expected.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes a bug where inversion on shortcuts with text with newlines sometimes did not work properly.

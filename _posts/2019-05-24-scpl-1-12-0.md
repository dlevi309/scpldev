# 1.12.0, ScPL Update

ScPL 1.12.0 has a new `@If` macro, TitleCase inversion, and support for Boolean and Enum types in `:filter`

## New Features

> Added the `@If` macro taking a Boolean, IfTrue, and IfFalse options.
> If Boolean is True, IfTrue will be inserted. Otherwise IfFalse.
> 
> Example:
> ```scpleditor
> @set UseMyName true
> @if @:UseMyName @{
>   Text "Me"
> } @{
>   Text "Someone"
> }
> ```
> is equivalent to
> ```scpleditor
> Text "Me"
> ```
> If you set UseMyName to false, it will be
> ```scpleditor
> Text "Someone"
> ```

---

> Inversion now inverts in TitleCase. This means that `OpenURLs` will be used instead of `openurls`.
> This should make inverted shortcuts easier to read and give a better demo of what ScPL is like.

---

> Boolean and Enumeration filters are now supported. Enumeration filters are only implemented in 
> FindPhotos right now, but can be easily added to other filters. Boolean fields have been added
> for all filters.
> 
> Example:
> ```scpleditor
> FindPhotos :filter{IsAScreenshot Is true :and: Name contains "testname" :and: IsFavorite Is false}
> ```

## Minor Changes

- Added `@ShowInWidget` macro to choose if a shortcut should be shown in the notification center.
- Added inversion support for `@Icon` and `@Color` when inverting shortcuts with an icon and color set.

## Dev Changes

- Added an optional `ccOverride` option to `parse()` to set a custom cc when parsing.

# 1.13.10, ScPL Update

## New Features

> Raw support! Still work in progress, raw support allows ScPL
> to import shortcuts that contain unsupported actions. These
> will be added to the code with the syntax `:raw "action.name"`
> and parameters will all have labels. 
> 
> Some things do not work yet, including actions with magic
> variables. These may be imported with an incorrect UUID.

## Minor Changes

- Most existing parameter errors have been converted to warnings.
  Neither the scpl editor or cli tool support the full extent of
  warnings yet, but when they do, warnings will allow multiple
  errors to be shown at once. This is especially useful in an
  editor where errors can be underlined red. This is less useful
  in the cli.

## Documentation

- Minor improvements to the unimplemented parameter message
- Some actions were incorrectly labeled as supported in the documentation.
  This has been fixed.
- Filter actions are now labeled as incomplete in the documentation
  if they are not fully supported.

## Dev Changes

- Significant changes to testing, now tests are written as scpl
  files and show up in git diffs when they change. Tests are now
  much easier to write.
- The node api now has the ability to inverse shortcuts with a
  custom indent level and quote style.
